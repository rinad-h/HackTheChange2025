# Bit By Bit

**Connecting Clagry, Bit by Bit**

## Story
During and after the pandemic, many of us felt disconnected from our communities. Neighbors became strangers, local events went unnoticed, and safety concerns were often shared too late. We wanted to change that.

**Bit By Bit** was born out of a desire to rebuild that sense of connection: a platform where Calgarians can stay informed, engaged, and empowered. Whether it’s sharing a local event, alerting others about safety concerns, or supporting small businesses, Bit By Bit helps people come together to strengthen their neighborhoods.

## Mission
At **Bit By Bit**, our mission is to strengthen Calgary communities by fostering **connection, safety, and inclusivity**. We provide residents across every Calgary ward with a platform to:

- Share updates and news relevant to their neighborhoods  
- Support and discover local businesses  
- Stay informed about community safety

By enabling residents to post and engage by ward and topic, Bit By Bit helps make Calgary a more **connected, resilient, and vibrant city** for everyone.
